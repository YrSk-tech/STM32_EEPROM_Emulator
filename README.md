## STM32 EEPROM Emulator with State Machine

This application demonstrates how to save and read data from the STM32 EEPROM Emulator. It uses a state machine for debugging purposes, allowing the user to verify if three variables have been successfully saved inside the flash memory. 

- **Read Operation**: When the flash memory is read, LED D2 turns on, indicating the data has been retrieved.
- **Write Operation**: When new values are written to the flash memory, LED D2 turns off.

This project provides a simple and visual way to confirm the functionality of EEPROM emulation on STM32 microcontrollers.
